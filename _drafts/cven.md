Hi! Let me introduce myself, Sebastian. I work in the WEB, more specifically in backend,
even more specifically in PHP, since 2013.

I am what we can call a passionate person, with a well-stocked library for
expand my knowledge. I always have a book by my side to keep improving.

I am someone who cares about the products I work on.
The health of the latter, both financially and architecturally, is what matters most to me.

## Expérience

---

### PROGI (2021 - AUJOUD’HUI)
#### Développeur PHP
- Maintain and improve the app
- Modernize the current application

This is where I am, soon to be my first year.

### BRITELYNX (2019 - 2021)
#### Architect PHP
- Maintain and improve the app
- Communication with customer for improvement and corrections to be made
- E-commerce and invoicing management
- Modernize the current application
- Communication with various APIs
- Provide support required for the application

Who would have thought?
From that moment, I am working remotely, and I love it!
A few months after starting my new telecommuting job, it becomes mandatory.
I will not draw a drawing of the latter, because everyone knows how it happened.
It is also from this moment that I become the sole manager of an application.
The latter did not have the love she should have had and I take responsibility for the latter.
I started by learning about this application, because no one was responsible for it anymore.
I took the time I needed to understand it and correct many of the problems.
From a migration from SVN to GIT keeping the complete history to a PHP update
through the complete structure of the application.

### NUMERIQUE.CA (2015 - 2019)
#### Développeur PHP
- Work with a "custom framework" to model it and respond to customer requests
- Support various version of this "framework" for various customers and continue their development to meet their needs (e-commerce, delivery route, automatic invoicing)
- Modernize the current "framework"

Numérique.ca allowed me to deepen my knowledge of PHP with their custom CMS.
By working for several clients, all with very different needs.
Whether it's [renting a cottage](https://www.cottagesrental.com/) with an auction system or developing a content generation system, I learned a lot at Numérique.ca.
It was also during these years that support for PHP 5.6 ended.
For all those who were present, or those who have the misfortune to still be in it,
there was a lot of breaking change (
[PHP 7.0](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration70.incompatible.php),
[PHP 7.1](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration71.incompatible.php),
[PHP 7.2](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration72.incompatible.php),
[PHP 7.3](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration73.incompatible.php),
[PHP 7.4](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.incompatible.php)
).
PHP underwent a fundamental change that still reverberates today with a massive gain in performance and opening up to an imaginable horizon.
I finish my run just before the release of PHP 8, I enjoyed making these migrations.

This is also where I discovered the magic of `containers` with Docker.
A tool that just makes my life easier!
I also took my first steps with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

### LATE NIGHT STUDIO (2013 - 2015)
#### Programmeur PHP
- Communicate and train customers, integrator and web developer using CMS (Made Simple, Wordpress)
- Maintain the different sites

We all started somewhere.
For me, my journey begins here.
In this job, I made simple websites using CMS (content management system) like [CMS Made Simple](http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/) and [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/).
It was in these two CMS that I started PHP programming and got hooked.
